This folder contains two folders named 'CHGCAR_files' and 'CHGCAR_images'. It also contains a machine learning code and an excel sheet to read data from. 


CHGCAR_files: This folder contains all the CHGCAR files, generated by running DFT simulations. It contains 137 CHGCAR files for all the different system used for studying. For detail about the system composition, please refer to excel sheet named "SFE_information.xlsx" or open the CHGCAR file using vesta. 


CHGCAR_images: This folder contains images made using CHGCAR files. 


Excel sheet: Name: "SFE_information.xlsx". This sheet contains the stacking fault energy value for all the system studied. It also contains abstract information about the systems composition used. 

Please note that for running this code requires only the folder names "CHGCAR_images" and model progress is also saved in this folder itself.
