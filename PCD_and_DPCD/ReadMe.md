This repository contains data used for predicting stacking fault energy from charge density. The work has already been published "https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0122675__;!!PTd7Sdtyuw!Sx-tZV496f4Istg6rT_7YM80nb3RUm-zSERKvHU9d_T0fzi69VwaBP5SsaLTlouyqizeUFPmPF7KaGJWug$  "

Excel sheet contains the necessary information used for training the machine learning model. Detail about all the descriptors can be found in the published article. Charge denisty are obtained using the software package called VASPKIT ("https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://vaspkit.com/__;!!PTd7Sdtyuw!Sx-tZV496f4Istg6rT_7YM80nb3RUm-zSERKvHU9d_T0fzi69VwaBP5SsaLTlouyqizeUFPmPF4R3OKcYg$  "). Bader charge and volume were extracted using bader analysis. Each sheet contain different dataset based on the composotion. Detail about the composition is given in the python code as well as in the article. 
Python code can be used to train the machine learning model for the data in the excel sheet. Different datasets can be used for training and testing depending upon the composition. Details about the dataset is also given in the code itself.
